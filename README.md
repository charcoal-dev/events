The Charcoal Events base library offers an innovative solution to a longstanding limitation of PHP: its inherently
synchronous execution model. This library simulates event-driven architectures by leveraging callbacks, allowing PHP
developers to experience semblance of asynchronous programming, even if it's not native to the language.

For detailed information, guidance, and setup instructions regarding this library, please refer to our official
documentation website:
